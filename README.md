# Missed Schedule 

Publish future post when publication date is pasted and WP fail. Prefer WP-CRON CLI usage instead synchronous execution.

## Requirements

* WordPress > 4.4
* PHP > 5.6

## Customization and hooks

This plugin does not have a hook.

It is possible to force the publication synchronously with the following constant. Otherwise, the articles will be published via the WP_CRON tasks.

```
<?php 
if ( ! defined( 'ENABLE_SYNC_MISSED_CHECK' ) ) {
	define( 'ENABLE_SYNC_MISSED_CHECK', true );
}
```
